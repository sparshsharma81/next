# next
this is the readme file and testing its working
there are two routers 
app base and page based
in the app base there is page base navigation
 and in the app also there is page based navigation ...
 page based router --- old way
  app base -- new way
   
   page base is stable -- meanwhile app has 
   but app is the future 
   page based is used to develop full stack ...it has predefined configuration 

   app based is used after next 13 update

   there are files..
   page.jsx
   layout.jsx --cover of the page
   error.jsx ---in case of runtime error..it will show up
   not-found.jsx---if the page is not found..then it will get executed///
   loading.jsx --- in the case of loading..this page get executed///
   they are fixed files 

   export const metadata = {
  title: "Create Next App",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
};

 in the layout page..there is a default variable called metadata-- which contain title and descritping
 this is the default title and description of the file

 this is basically creating auto head tag///
 


 "@/*": ["./src/*"]  ---- this means that pure file me ham kahi bhi ise likhe..
 ye hame src folder me leke jayega
import Header from "@/component/Header";
